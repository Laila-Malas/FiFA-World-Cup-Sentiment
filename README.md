## Abstract 
FIFA 2022 has sparked a global trend, showcasing Qatar's capabilities and the performances of countries in the matches. It has elicited varied reactions on social media, 
as people express their opinion, sentiments  about the results and anticipate the performance improvements over the next four years ,
therefore this paper aims to extract data from Facebook to find people's prediction feelings and sentiments toward FIFA World Cup 2022 for
better performance and predictions for the future world cup.Where this research  focused on more than one aspect, including the timeline aspect 
to find out the number of reactions during the FIFA World cup period and the aspect of sentiment and text analysis using the special Azure Cloud Service
which is a Natural Language processing tool that analyze texts and posts to find sentiment analysis and people's feelings toward FIFA , in addition to
the aspect of predicting these sentiments by comparing the Multinomial Naive Bayse algorithm and Deep Learning Algorithm Forword Neural Network to reach 
an accurate model that can predict people's feelings towards what happened in FIFA 2022 and the upcoming FIFA years.Which conclude that  Deep Learning Algorithm 
outperforms Multinomial naive bayes by  57.4\% ,but in terms of precision,Recall and F1-Score Multinomial naive bayes outperform Deep Learning Algorithm.
This requires us to answer the following question:will this system predict people's feelings on social media accurately, 
so that it affects the performance of teams and players in FIFA 2026 ? The answer is what this research paper covers.

## Code Description
1) ### facebook data : 
This File extract data from facebook and gathered in one csv file called  fifa.csv then this dataset preprocessed until generate a new csv file called sentiment2.csv for prediction

2) ### Sentiment2 csv file : 
used for text preprocessing , deep learning and multinominal naive code
